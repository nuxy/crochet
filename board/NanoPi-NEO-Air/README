NanoPi NEO Air has been tested to work with FreeBSD 13

============================================================

What is a NanoPi NEO Air?
-------------------------

The NanoPi NEO Air is a 32-bit Quad-core Cortex-A7 single
board computer created by FriendlyElec.

Details can be found at:

You boot it from a MicroSDHC card with the system image.

Once you have the device working, you can expand it by
updating the 8GB eMMC using dd from an external device, or
attach microcontrollers to GPIO connectors on the board.

ATTENTION:
   SDIO support requires the GENERIC-MMCCAM kernel config.

============================================================

Booting the device
------------------

1. Insert a microSD card with this generated image.

2. Power on the board by connecting to a MicroUSB cable.

3. Connect using a USB to TTL Serial Cable (115200 8N1)

============================================================

Flashing the eMMC (CAVEAT)
--------------------------

Since you cannot update the eMMC from a running microSD you
will need to attach an external hard disk that runs the
generated image. This can be achieved using a 1-bay NAS Dock
that can be purchased from the FriendlyElec website.
